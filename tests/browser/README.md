# Browser tests (Playwright, no Firebase project needed)

`fakefb.js` replaces the Firebase compat SDK with an in-memory fake, so every screen runs against seeded data
without touching the real project. `harness.js` serves `index.html` from a local HTTP server and routes
`vendor/firebase/*` to the fake.

```
cd <repo root>
python3 -m http.server 8765 &

`xss.js` prints `hits: []` when nothing rendered as HTML; `auth.js` prints a JSON object where every value must be `true` (or the expected list) and ends with `AUTH OK`; `pwa.js` ends with `PWA/NOTIFY OK` and `palette.js` with `PALETTE OK`, `govern.js` with `GOVERN OK`, `polish.js` with `POLISH OK`, `offline.js` with `OFFLINE OK`, `sms055.js` with `SMS055 OK`, `closures.js` with `CLOSURES OK`, `debts.js` with `DEBTS OK`.
